# ShellcodeLdr-Dev [FOR BEGINNERS]

## Learn Shellcode Loaders development with me!

ShellcodeLdr1:
  - Just a basic shellcode loader which uses sockets to connect to a remote machine, downloads the shellcode (.bin) file and executes in memory. I have used EarlyBird APCInjection technique for execution.
  - Doesn't evade any AV/EDRs.
